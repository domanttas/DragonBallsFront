From beautiful sights, to food & shelter, to maintaining the delicate balance necessary to sustain life on this planet.

        Cats and dogs depend on humans for their everyday needs â€“ food, water, shelter, veterinary care, love and more. Yet thousands of animals have no guardian to care for them, let alone a warm, comfortable place to curl up in at night. Many suffer and die on the streets or have to be euthanised for lack of good homes. Animal homelessness is a complex crisis,but you can make it easier with your actions.
